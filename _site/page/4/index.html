	<h1>Miller-Rabin Primality Test</h1>
	<p>Back when I started messing around with code, I was told to try out <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> to improve my coding skills (something I suggest everyone do). I was able to progress fairly well along but I always struggled with the questions involving prime numbers because I could never get my code to run efficiently on them.</p>

<p>I looked for a solution and repeatedly only found mention to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>, which is fairly intuitive and appeared to be the go-to primality test. However, in my early days of programming, I still struggled to implement the algorithm so I ultimately pushed those prime-based questions off to the side.</p>

<p>Years later, while reading Brian Christian’s and Tom Griffiths’ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365">Algorithms to Live By</a>, I happened across the <strong>Miller-Rabin Primality Test</strong>, an alternative to the Sieve of Eratosthenes. The algorithm works as follows: say you wanted to test if <script type="math/tex">n</script> (an odd integer) is a prime number. To do so, we can first find <script type="math/tex">r</script> and <script type="math/tex">s</script> such that <script type="math/tex">n = 2^r s + 1</script>. Next, we can pick a random integer <script type="math/tex">a</script> such that <script type="math/tex">1 \leq a \leq n - 1</script>. With <script type="math/tex">a, r, s</script> all defined, we next test if <script type="math/tex">a^s = 1 \textrm{  mod  } n</script> or <script type="math/tex">a^{2js} = -1 \textrm{  mod  } n</script> for some <script type="math/tex">0 \leq j \leq r - 1</script>. If either of these equalities are true, then we can say that <script type="math/tex">n</script> passes the test and any prime number will pass the test. It is fairly trivial to test this for pretty much any <script type="math/tex">n</script>. However, the trick with this algorithm is that non-prime numbers will also pass this test (return a false-positive) <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{4}</script> of the time.</p>

<p>To correct for this, we can try the test again with a new randomly-selected <script type="math/tex">a</script>. If <script type="math/tex">n</script> again passes the test, we know that there is a <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{16}</script> chance that <script type="math/tex">n</script> is not actually a prime. Therefore, if we repeated the test <script type="math/tex">N</script> times successfully, we can say that there is a <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{4^N}</script> chance that <script type="math/tex">n</script> is not actually a prime number. Using this method, we can determine if a particular number is prime with fairly high certainty after only a few iterations. For example, if we repeat the test <script type="math/tex">N = 5</script> times, we can declare <script type="math/tex">n</script> to be prime with 99.9% certainty. If <script type="math/tex">n</script> passes after <script type="math/tex">N = 10</script> iterations, we know with 99.9999% certainty.</p>

<p>Using this, I took another crack at those pesky prime-based Project Euler problems and what do you know, it worked like a charm! While there is a very, very, very slim chance that this still returns a false-positive (I’m using <script type="math/tex">N = 8</script> so a 0.00153% chance), given the non-critical context of the application, I’ll definitely take the speed increase over the non-100% certainty.</p>

<p>For anyone interested, I’ve included a sample implementation in Python of the algorithm below.</p>

	<h1>PCA and K-Means on NHL Stats</h1>
	<p>After all this learning of PCA and <a href="/2016/03/09/clustering-with-kmeans.html">k-means clustering</a>, I wanted to try a small test to see how they would work on some real data. I pulled a bunch of stats for the 30 NHL teams and wanted to see how those could be used to categorize each team making (or not making) the Stanley Cup Playoffs. First I reduced the data to just the key features (using PCA) and then tried clustering from that. And what do you know, it worked!</p>

<p>It only messed up on Boston and Detroit but they were in a tight race to make the playoffs up until the very end, so that makes sense, given the context. Math continues to prevail!</p>

<p>For anyone interested, you can find the MATLAB code for this example <a href="https://github.com/ben-tanen/DataMining/tree/master/nhl-clustering">here</a>.</p>

	<h1>Visualizing My (Unhealthy) Netflix History</h1>
	<p>TV is pretty incredible, and I’ll admit I might binge-watch from time to time. In fact, I’ve been binge-watching since before it was cool - I watched all of The Office on Netflix back in 2009 when there were only 4 season available. So I decided to see what this history of binge-watching looked like.</p>

<p>Getting the information was pretty simple. I just had to scrape the data via Netflix’s own viewing history page, clean it a bit, and then pipe it into MATLAB.</p>

<p>
    <a class="img_link" href="/img/posts/netflix_history.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="/img/posts/netflix_history.png" />
    </a>
</p>

<p>I find it interesting that there are huge spikes during my winter breaks but dips during my summer breaks. Maybe I was playing outside… One thing is for sure, I definitely watch a lot of TV.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is only the TV I’ve watched via Netflix and doesn’t include when I’ve watched shows offline (like Community, Billions, etc). </p>

	<h1>Support Vector Machines and Poetry</h1>
	<p>My tales of data mining continue and this time, they’re about <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/ml/introduction_to_svm/introduction_to_svm.html">support vector machines</a>. These fancy little classifiers are particularly awesome when it comes to aiding a computer in distinguishing between two (or more) groups of data. I previously wrote about <a href="/2016/03/09/clustering-with-kmeans.html">k-means clustering</a> which is a great way to quickly cluster some existing data. However, when it comes to classifying new data points, clustering isn’t a fantastic method.</p>

<p>As an alternative, SVMs are pretty great at providing classifications that work for existing data <em>and</em> future data. An example that I found particular interesting was used to distinguish between poems written in English and poems written in German. For example, take the following two excerpts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Aktenstose nachts verschlingen, Schwatzen nach der Welt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s pretty obvious to anyone who speaks English or German which language these poems are written in. But to a naive computer, these are just strings of characters. To aid in distinguishing, let’s consider two features of these 50-character excerpts: the number of complete words and the number of times the letter “i” occurs.</p>

<p>Using this information as the main “features” of our data, we can compute and define a hyperplane (or in this case, a line) to find if there is a meaningful division between English and German given the “features” we are analyzing (for more on the math behind this, see <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/ml/introduction_to_svm/introduction_to_svm.html">here</a>). If we compute and plot this for ten different excerpts, we get the following:</p>

<p>
    <a class="img_link" href="/img/posts/svm_poems.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="/img/posts/svm_poems.png" width="500px" />
    </a>
</p>

<p>We can see that, for the most part, German poems end up on the left side of the line and English poems end up on the right, indicating at least a mildly significant relationship in our features. To further test it, we can try another <em>new</em> excerpt: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Hat der alte Hexenmeister sich doch einmal wegbege</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we go ahead and plot this (seen above in magenta), we can see that this obviously German poem is again partitioned as expected without needing to update our hyperplane. Hurray, math works!</p>

<p>For anyone interested, you can find the MATLAB code for this example <a href="https://github.com/ben-tanen/DataMining/tree/master/svm-poems">here</a> and other data mining projects <a href="https://github.com/ben-tanen/data-mining">here</a>.</p>
