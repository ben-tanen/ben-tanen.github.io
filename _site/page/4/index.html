	<h1>Visualizing My Spotify History</h1>
	<p>As most people do, I go through phases of musical interests. I’ll listen to one artist for a week and then switch to someone different the next. I thought it would be cool to visualize these phases and the shifts in my listening, you know, just for fun. So using Last.fm’s scrobbling data, <a href="https://gist.github.com/bitmorse/5201491">this handy script</a>, and some Python / pandas, I was able to see just what I was listening over the past few years.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/lastfm_linegraph.png" width="600px" /></p>

<p>The process was pretty simple. Once I found the existing script (link above), I simply had to parse through the text, load it into a pandas DataFrame, and do some simple analysis. Knowing that, I plan on going a little deeper and seeing what cool stuff I can find.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Note</strong>: This data only reflects my listening history on computer. For some reason Spotify Mobile is set to scrobble my listening history but is refusing to actually do so. Oh well…</p>

<p>For more, you can see the whole iPython notebook <a href="/notebooks/lastfm_scrobble.html">here</a> (Hurray for iPython notebooks, they’re awesome).</p>

	<h1>Best Of "Data is Beautiful" #1</h1>
	<p>As I briefly mentioned in a <a href="/2014/10/31/rap-data-design.html">previous post</a>, I am a big fan of well-designed representations of data. If you’re also a fan of this “art form” then you should be an avid follower of the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful">/r/dataisbeautiful</a>. If you’ve never seen it, it’s a must read.</p>

<p>Pretty much all of the posts are cool but there are a few that are definitely a cut above. I decided every once in awhile I’d highlight my personal favorites. So without further ado…</p>

<h3 id="nba-shot-chartshttpsavvastjortjogloucomnba-shot-shartshtml"><a href="http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nba-shot-sharts.html">NBA Shot Charts</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/dib_basketball.png" width="600px" /></p>

<p>I’m not a huge NBA fan but I do know there is a crazy amount of data available about the game - maybe second only to <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rich-data-poor-data/">baseball</a>. I guess Savvas Tjortjoglou decided to map that data to show a very comprehensive shot chart. The post is well-done, especially the way that he actually goes about mapping the data onto the court as singular points and heat maps.</p>

<h3 id="mapping-the-uk-via-pubshttpramiroorgnotebookmapping-pubs"><a href="http://ramiro.org/notebook/mapping-pubs/">Mapping the UK via Pubs</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/dib_pubs.png" width="600px" /></p>

<p>This is just one of those things that will make you LQTY (laugh quietly to yourself, the truer form of LOL). Of course the United Kingdom can be be well mapped through all of its pubs. While not a dense as, Ireland does a good job of dispersing its drinking establishments. Scotland is just lacking though - come on Scotland! The actual data work being done here is pretty simple but it’s cool nonetheless.</p>

<h3 id="swearing-across-americahttpwwwhuffingtonpostcomentrywhich-curse-words-are-popular-in-your-state55a80662e4b04740a3df54b8"><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/which-curse-words-are-popular-in-your-state_55a80662e4b04740a3df54b8">Swearing Across America</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://img.huffingtonpost.com//asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/55a9001d1900002500b86ee1.png" width="500px" /></p>

<p>I particularly enjoy this one and everything it has to say about the different regions of the US. Coming from the Northeast, I have to generally agree with the maps - I don’t remember the last time I heard someone say “Gosh” seriously. I was also quite amused by the tiny spike in the use of “Bitch” in Fairfield County Connecticut. Fairfield reppin’!</p>

<p>Rather than using API access like the others, this post also had a pretty interesting way of gathering the data. While I’m still slightly unsure of utilizing Twitter / Geolocation for accurate data science, for the matter of this post I’ll accept their method. </p>

<h3 id="randomly-finding-someonehttpemptypipesorg20150803random-finding"><a href="http://emptypipes.org/2015/08/03/random-finding/">Randomly Finding Someone</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/posts/dib_randomfinding.gif" /></p>

<p>Finally, while not quite as data set driven as the other posts, this post from Empty Pipes features a cool and simple animation to simulate the “randomly searching” process - hurray for pretty gifs. He even built a tool for anyone to try out tool / animation. </p>

<p>While incredibly simplified, his analysis does seem to be leading in the general right direction for the best method to find someone in a large crowd. Then again this also seems like the perfect opportunity to use FindMyFriends or a good ol’ phone call.</p>

	<h1>Random Project: Censor Machine</h1>
	<p>Do you ever need / want a simple Internet tool and it seems like it would be easier code it than find it? That is exactly what happened when I needed a beeping censor. Sometimes bands like to swear and I need a button / website to defend the honor of the FCC. Thus, I made this really <a href="http://ben-tanen.github.io/CensorMachine/">stupid site</a>. But hey, now I have it.</p>

	<h1>Old Python Games / Projects</h1>
	<p>After posting my two most recent retro posts, I thought I’d post some of my older projects. When I was learning Python, I sort of had a fascination with making games as can be seen by most of these projects.</p>

<p>The first project was Battleship. This was based on the project that Codacademy had you build as you learned Python. This version is more extended than the Codacademy, but to be honest, without looking back at the Codacademy version, I’m not sure how or why… Either way, here is the <a href="https://github.com/ben-tanen/PythonGames/blob/master/battleship.py">code on Github</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/python_game_minesweeper.png" alt="Good Ol' Unix Terminal Games" /></p>

Good Ol' Unix Terminal Games
</figcaption>

<p>This next project was my first original game, Minesweeper! It was built very much like Battleship but the logic was a little more complicated. As you can see, it’s not expertly written since this was after like a month of knowing Python. I might consider re-writting / refactoring the code not that I’m a tad more experienced. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/ben-tanen/PythonGames/blob/master/minesweeper.py">original code on GH</a>.</p>

<p>A year later than my other games, I decided to build a blackjack game. This was made with the knowledge of classes so I decided to go down that route instead of a constant single chunk of code (see other games). It’s not much better written, but it does include the ability to “count cards” which is cool. Again, <a href="https://github.com/ben-tanen/PythonGames/blob/master/blackjack.py">here’s the code</a>.</p>

<p>And because I was bored, I also threw in some better versions of the first two games with some serious refactoring / feature improvement into <a href="https://github.com/ben-tanen/PythonGames">the repo</a>. Minesweeper reveals sections of 0s now! I noticed I was also doing some weird sort of logical boolean using a string of spaces. It was weird. I took it out. It’s better now.</p>

<p>If you’re at all interested, give them a play and maybe even play around with the code. I did make them, but I have to say “objectively” I think they’re pretty fun.</p>
