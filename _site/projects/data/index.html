            <div/>
            <p><p>In response to a suggestion from Franklin Leonard, the Washington Post recently published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrvODeA8-E" target="_blank">a video</a> providing an hour-by-hour comparison of how President Obama and President Trump responded in the wake of school shootings. The video is a very compelling piece for comparing (and contrasting) the differences in these two presidents’ approaches.</p>

<p>The video did a great job juxtaposing Obama’s and Trump’s intraday activities and responses (comparing Obama’s first day of response to Trump’s, etc.), but I felt it was hard to compare the actual timing of each event. I decided to re-visualize <span id="footnote-1" class="footnote">this information</span> into one single timeline to (hopefully) present a slightly different effect.</p>

            <div/>
            <p><p>Sunday marked the official end of the 2018 Olympics Games. Overall, they did not disappoint. There were some great moments and highlights all around. As an objectively not-objective American, I was a bit disappointed with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/02/america-winter-olympics-worst-2018/554438/">the United States’ overall performance</a> but there were some amazing individual performances (shoutout to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3opTwpiCZ6c">Chloe Kim</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRmZUNO4Y5s">the U.S. Women’s Hockey Team</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/12/sports/olympics/jamie-anderson-gold-slopestyle.html">Jamie Anderson</a>).</p>

<p>Speaking of performances, I was doubly curious about how my first attempt at <a href="/blog/2018/02/06/fantasy-olympics.html">Fantasy Olympics rules and projections</a> went. Now on the other side of the PyeongChang Games, I stand by my original set of rules for Fantasy Olympics. I think drafting teams by country and sport forms an interesting mix of teams and I think the weighted scoring system serves as a good counter-balance for fair drafting. So overall, Fantasy Olympics rules = 👍.</p>

            <div/>
            <p><p>I love the Olympics and the upcoming 2018 Games have me fired up. Following my first season in <a href="/blog/2017/09/07/evaluating-fantasy-draft.html">a fantasy football league this year</a>, I thought it would be a fun idea to try and make my own fantasy game for the Olympics. So with only a limited amount of knowledge of what makes a good fantasy game, I got to work on my own Fantasy Olympics.</p>

<p>One of the initial problems I foresaw with a game for the Olympics was the average person’s familiarity with individual athletes. While everyone knows the big stars (Michael Phelps, Shaun White, etc.), most viewers would probably struggle to name more than a handful of individual athletes. There is the same issue with fantasy football and defenses. In fantasy football, most leagues remedy this by having fantasy players draft whole defenses instead of individual defensemen and I thought a similar scheme would be a good solution for my own Fantasy Olympics problem.</p>

<p>So, instead of drafting a bunch of individual athletes, Fantasy Olympics players pick from teams of athletes by nationality and sport. For example, instead of drafting individual speed skaters, you might draft the speed skating team from the Netherlands (an excellent pick, given that they won 19 total medals at the Sochi games). You would then be awarded points for any medals won by any Dutch speed skaters.</p>

            <div/>
            <p><p>Last year, after the Pittsburgh Penguins won the Stanley Cup for the second year in a row, I was very interested in the idea of existing or emerging sports dynasties. At the time, of the four major (American) sports, the winners of three of the four league champions had also previously won in the prior two years. The Patriots won the Super Bowl in 2015 and 2017, Pittsburgh won the Stanley Cup in 2016 and 2017, and the Warriors <span id="sd-footnote-1" class="footnote">won in</span> 2015 and 2017. This seemed kind of incredible to me and at the time, I was curious if this was a common occurrence and if so, if it manifested itself in any interesting ways. I got started on some visualizations to explore this but never really got anywhere.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today: the Patriots are again going back to the Super Bowl and again this question of sport dynasties has been floating around in my head. It’s obvious the Patriots are in the midst of a dynasty and a sixth Super Bowl win in 17 years would just be a cherry on top. But the Patriots aren’t alone - this level of excellence seems to be a trend for Boston sports in general. Since 2001, Boston has <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2017/01/30/tom-caron-bostons-had-nine-sports-titles-since-2001-and-patriots-look-to-make-it-10-on-sunday/">won nine championship titles</a>, so beyond just the Patriots, it seems like Boston as a city is in the midst of a sports dynasty. So I decided to expand my original quandary and instead ask: when and where have their been other city-wide sports dynasties?</p>

            <div/>
            <p><p>I recently came across <a href="http://kut.org/post/uttt-poll-most-texas-voters-say-confederate-memorials-shouldn-t-move-0">an article</a> from KUT, Austin’s NPR station, about Confederate statues with the following news graphic:</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/posts/confederate-monuments-poll.jpg" alt="The original graphic on Confederate statues" width="550" />
    </a>
</p>

<p>The contents of the graphic and the results of the poll were interesting, but more than anything, I was intrigued by their choice of chart type. On my first viewing, it took me a second to mentally reconcile what exactly was going on. What were all the bars? Why all the colors? I then noticed the clustering and realized it was not just any bar chart, but instead a clustered <em>and</em> stacked bar chart. It’s now clear they wanted to emphasize the contrast between the “move or remove” responses and the “leave them” responses, but with so many bars and mixed colors, I found myself lost in comparisons.</p>

            <div/>
            <p><p>Over the years, I’ve always been interested in the idea of fantasy football but I had never committed to a league. This year, I decided to take the plunge and try out my own fantasy team. While I would consider myself a fan of football, I knew I didn’t know enough about the whole league to really stand a chance at putting together a <em>good</em> fantasy team. So I decided I would just rely on the advice of the pros.</p>

<p>First, by suggestion of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/sports/fantasy-football-draft-guide-beginners.html">New York Times</a>, I consulted <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/">Fantasy Pros</a> and <a href="https://www.5thdownfantasy.com/">5th Down Fantasy</a>. To supplement these fairly reliable yet relatively standard sources, I thought I would try out a little crowd sourcing experiment of my own. Since I would be competing against other humans, I thought it would be interesting to see how the general masses valued certain players. To assess this, I entered a bunch of different mock drafts on ESPN and recorded the picks as the people and auto-draft did their things. I then compiled the data from each of these drafts, along with the Fantasy Pros and 5th Down suggestions, and made a handy little draft guide.</p>

            <p><p>After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs">this recent video from Numberphile</a>, I decided to throw together my own little visualizer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game">the chaos game</a>.</p>

<p>To briefly explain the game, we basically start by randomly placing some “bases” on our board and a single starting point that is within those bases. We then randomly select one of our bases and move our point half way closer to our chosen base. We can repeat this operation endlessly, or until something starts to form. The cool part of this game is what forms when we mark our moves. Our seemingly random behavior actually begins to form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal</a>!</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/" target="_blank">D3 and Mike Bostock</a> have generally implemented every type of chart imaginable, I was surprised that I couldn’t find anything like this sort of polar line chart that I could use for other data sets.

One of the main problems of the course deals with finding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull" target="_blank">convex hull</a> of a set of points. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnTiWcIznEQ" target="_blank">a number ways</a> to tackle the problem but one of the best approaches is the Kirkpatrick-Seidel Ultimate Planar Convex Hull Algorithm. In order to help teach the algorithm, I made <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/ultimate-ch/" target="_blank">a visualization tool</a> to walk-through the steps.</p>

There exist certain stereotypes about which countries drink which types of alcohol - the French with their wine, Russians and their vodka, etc. - and we wanted to build a platform to either confirm or debunk these stereotypes. In a greater sense, we hoped to explore when and how alcohol has been part of culture and history.

While this isn’t a particularly surprising result (the United States is consistently a top contender in the Olympics), it is interesting to wonder why the U.S. is able to perform so well.</p>

            <p><p>My tales of data mining continue and this time, they’re about <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/ml/introduction_to_svm/introduction_to_svm.html">support vector machines</a>. These fancy little classifiers are particularly awesome when it comes to aiding a computer in distinguishing between two (or more) groups of data. I previously wrote about <a href="/blog/2016/03/09/clustering-with-kmeans.html">k-means clustering</a> which is a great way to quickly cluster some existing data. However, when it comes to classifying new data points, clustering isn’t a fantastic method.</p>

            <div/>
            <p><p>This semester, I’m taking a special topics course on data mining through the Tufts Math department. Up until now, we had primarily focused on the moderately complex math behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">PCA analysis</a>. However, we are starting to move onto look at new types of data analysis / clustering and today’s topic was <strong>k-means clustering</strong>. This sort of analysis deals with much less complex math (at least it does thus far) and from a CS student’s perspective, is much easier to rationalize. It’s a fairly simple algorithm and it does have some cool results.</p>

            <div/>
            <p><p>For an interview, I was recently assigned the task of determining the ideal optimized hedge ratio of a portfolio of 3 - 5 different equity instruments. I approached this by attempting to reduce the risk, which is generally measured as variance or volatility, of the portfolio (this theory / approach was further backed up by this <a href="http://dahl.mines.edu/tech1503.pdf">paper</a>).</p>

            <div/>
            <p><p>As most people do, I go through phases of musical interests. I’ll listen to one artist for a week and then switch to someone different the next. I thought it would be cool to visualize these phases and the shifts in my listening, you know, just for fun. So using Last.fm’s scrobbling data, <a href="https://gist.github.com/bitmorse/5201491">this handy script</a>, and some Python / pandas, I was able to see just what I was listening to over the past few years.</p>
