<p>I’m Ben Tanen. I have a passion for thinking about, working with, and visualizing data of all forms, and I aspire to use data to tell interesting stories. I graduated from Tufts University in 2017 and I currently work as an analyst at Analysis Group in Boston, MA. <a href="/resume/BenjaminTanen_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">In the past</a>, I’ve worked as software developer and analyst at a few different software, finance, and consulting companies.</p>

<p>Over the years, I've worked on <!--a number of different projects, in school, for work, and on my own. I've worked on--> projects dealing with <a href="http://asl-lex.org/" target="_blank">sign language (both American and Turkish)</a>, <a href="http://ben-tanen.github.io/UltimateConvexHull/" target="_blank">computational geometry</a> and <a href="http://ben-tanen.github.io/AdaptiveHuffmanCoding/" target="_blank">compression algorithms</a>, <a href="https://jadeyychan.github.io/DrunkenWorld/" target="_blank">alcohol consumption</a>, and <a href="/projects/nhl-projections/files/NHL_Projections-Full_Report.pdf" target="_blank">the NHL playoffs</a>. You can find more on my project work <a href="/projects/">here</a>.</p>

{% assign post = site.posts.first %}
<p>On occasion, I'll <a href="/">write about things</a> I'm working on and other stuff that interests me. I most recently wrote about <a href="{{ post.url }}" target="_blank">{{ post.landing-description }}</a>.</p>

<p>For fun, I spin <a href="/projects/music/story-time/" target="_blank">a weekly radio show</a> as Papa T on Tufts' WMFO and I play pick-up hockey. I'm always looking for great music to add to <a href="/projects/music/vinyl" target="_blank">my collection</a> and I love chatting about filmmaking, law, and politics. <span id="currently-text">I'm currently listening to <a class="currently" id="currently-music-name" target="_blank">...</a> from <a class="currently" id="currently-music-artist" target="_blank">...</a> and I'm reading <a class="currently" id="currently-book-name" target="_blank">...</a> by <a class="currently" id="currently-book-author" target="_blank">...</a>.</span></p>
