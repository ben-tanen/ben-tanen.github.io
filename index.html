<p>Iâ€™m Ben Tanen. I have a passion for thinking about, working with, and visualizing data of all forms, and I aspire to use data to tell interesting stories. I live in Boston, MA and I've worked at Analysis Group since graduating from Tufts University in 2017.</p>

<p>Over the years, I've worked on projects dealing with <a href="/blog/2019/06/23/most-font.html" target="_new">font design</a>, <a href="/projects/oscars-popular-film/" target="_new">the Oscars</a>, <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/adaptive-huffman/" target="_new">compression algorithms</a>, <a href="/blog/2018/02/06/fantasy-olympics.html" target="_new">the Winter Olympics</a>, <a href="http://asl-lex.org/" target="_new">American Sign Language</a>, <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/ultimate-ch/" target="_new">computational geometry</a>, and <a href="/projects/nhl-projections/files/NHL_Projections-Full_Report.pdf" target="_new">the NHL playoffs</a>. Mostly recently, I wrote about <a href="{% if recentpost.reroute-url %}{{ recentpost.reroute-url }}{% else %}{{ recentpost.url }}{% endif %}">{{ recentpost.landing-description }}</a>. You can find more of my work <a href="/blog/all/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm always looking for great music to add to <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/vinyl/">my collection</a> and I love chatting about filmmaking, law, and politics. While at Tufts, I spun a weekly <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/papaT/">radio show</a> as Papa T on Tufts' WMFO and I played club hockey. On occasion, I take <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/photo/">pictures</a> with my camera. <span id="currently-text">I'm currently listening to <a class="currently hidden" id="currently-music-name" target="_new">...............</a> from <span class="currently" id="currently-music-artist">...............</span> and I'm reading <a class="currently hidden" id="currently-book-name" target="_new">...............</a> by <span class="currently hidden" id="currently-book-author">...............</span>.</span></p>
