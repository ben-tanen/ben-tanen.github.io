<p>I’m Ben Tanen. I have a passion for thinking about, working with, and visualizing data of all forms, and I aspire to use data to tell interesting stories. I graduated from Tufts University in 2017 and I currently work as an analyst at Analysis Group in Boston, MA. <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/resume/" target="_blank">In the past</a>, I’ve worked as software developer and analyst at a few different software, finance, and consulting companies.</p>

<p>Over the years, I've worked on projects dealing with <a href="http://asl-lex.org/" target="_blank">American Sign Language</a>, <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/ultimate-ch/" target="_blank">computational geometry</a> and <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/adaptive-huffman/" target="_blank">compression algorithms</a>, <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/drunken-world/" target="_blank">alcohol consumption</a>, and <a href="/projects/nhl-projections/files/NHL_Projections-Full_Report.pdf" target="_blank">the NHL playoffs</a>. You can find more on my project work <a href="/projects/">here</a>.</p>

<p>On occasion, I'll write about things I'm working on and other stuff that interests me. I most recently wrote about <a href="{{ post.url }}" target="_blank">{{ post.landing-description }}</a>. You can find all that I've written <a href="/blog/all/">here</a>.</p>

<p>For fun, I spin a weekly <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/papaT/" target="_blank">radio show</a> as Papa T on Tufts' WMFO and I play pick-up hockey. I'm always looking for great music to add to <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/vinyl/" target="_blank">my collection</a> and I love chatting about filmmaking, law, and politics. On occasion, I take <a href="http://link.ben-tanen.com/photo/" target="_blank">pictures</a> with my camera. <span id="currently-text">I'm currently listening to <a class="currently" id="currently-music-name" target="_blank">...............</a> from <span class="currently" id="currently-music-artist" target="_blank">...............</span> and I'm reading <a class="currently" id="currently-book-name" target="_blank">...............</a> by <span class="currently" id="currently-book-author" target="_blank">...............</span>.</span></p>
