Howdy! I'm Ben Tanen and I'm currently studying Computer Science Engineering, Mathematics, and Engineering Management at Tufts University. I have a passion for thinking with, working with, and visualizing data of all forms. During my summers, I've worked as software developer and analyst for a few different technology, finance, and consulting companies. Starting Fall 2017, I will be working full-time as an Analyst at Analysis Group in Boston.

Outside of work and school, I play for the Tufts Club Hockey team, I DJ a weekly radio show on WMFO, Tufts' Freeform Station, and I help run a mentorship program for Tufts Engineering students. I'm also a huge fan of soul music, law, politics, filmmaking, and spicy foods and I try to immerse myself in those whenever I can - let me know if you ever want to chat about them!
