Howdy! I'm Ben and I'm currently studying Computer Science Engineering, Mathematics, and Engineering Management at Tufts University. I have a passion for thinking with, working with, and visualizing data of all forms. When I graduate, I plan on continuing my work with data analytics and visualization.
