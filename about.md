What's up? I'm Ben. I'm a student currently studying Computer Science Engineering, Mathematics, and Engineering Management at Tufts University. I love working and thinking with data, particularly when relating to finance and economic models. I'm also particularly interested in clean, simple web design (as can be seen by this site). After I graduate, I'd like to go into data-driven software consulting - perhaps in finance.

That's all for now, but maybe I'll add more stuff later on. In the meantime, feel free to checkout out the rest of the site or my [Github](https://github.com/ben-tanen).

If you would like to contact me, you can [send me a message](mailto:ben.tanen@gmail.com).
