## Ben Tanen, Personal Website

This is my personal page. It's current interation is for the use of COMP-20. However, once the assignment is completed, an index to my Jekyll-based blog will be added (it'll likely use absolute URLs which are no-no's for the assignment).

#### Website To-Do:

- [ ] Fulfill COMP-20 Requirements
	- [ ] Add `resume.html` and `biography.html` pages
	- [ ] Check HTML5/CSS Validation (when complete)
- [ ] Write a better "This is Me" section
- [ ] Add Jekyll-based Blog (general)
	- [ ] Add index of most recent two posts on page
	- [ ] Format post pages
	- [ ] Create blog repo
- [ ] Add changing "Currently" section (with JS and Dropbox content)
	- [ ] Link current "Currently" section to Dropbox public file (to change automatically) 
	- [ ] Changing SVG symbols
	- [ ] Add time-interval changes on page (with animation)
