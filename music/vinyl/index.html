<p>I've been collecting albums ever since I was gifted my first record in 2013. Here's a running list of what I've got in my library so far. You can also find a record of what I'm listening to digitally via <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/ben-tanen">my Last.FM profile</a>.</p>

<p>Have a suggestion for an album I should check out? <a href="mailto:ben.tanen@gmail.com?subject=I have an album suggestion!">Drop me a line!</a></p>
