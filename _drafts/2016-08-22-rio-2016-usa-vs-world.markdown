The 2016 Summer Olympics finished last night after two spectacular weeks of competition. For anyone watching, it was fairly apparent that the United States did quite will during the Games, taking home the most medals with 121 total medals and 46 gold medals (51 total and 20 gold medals more than second place China). While this isn't a particularly surprising result (the United States is consistently a top contender in the Olympics), it is interesting to wonder why the U.S. is able to perform so well.

I've heard a few people refer to the size of the United States' Olympic team as a likely contributor. It would make sense that the U.S. would get more medals if they had more athletes participating in each event. However, on the surface, this doesn't quite explain since most events have a cap on the number of athletes that each country can send. For example, each country is only allowed to send three athletes per track & field event. If there is a limit on the number of athletes per event, then there must be further explanation of the United States' success.

Another major factor that should be considered is the number of sports that the U.S. competes in. Of the 31 total sports, the U.S. fields athletes in 30 while China and Great Britain (the next top contenders after the U.S.) field only 26 and 25 respectively. This means there are purely more chances for the U.S. to win medals even without skill as a consideration.

| Country | Athletes | Sports | Medals | Golds | Medals per Event | Golds per Event | Medals per Athlete | Golds per Athlete |
|---------|---- -----|--------|--------|-------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| USA <img src='https://ssl.gstatic.com/onebox/media/sports/logos/wj9uZvn_vZrelLFGH8fnPA_48x48.png' width='25px' style='margin-top:0px;'/> | 555 | 30 | 121 | 46 | 0.395 | 0.150 | 0.218 | 0.083 |

However, we can see that athletes from the U.S. do seem to actually perform better. By comparing the number of medals each athlete pulls in (on average) from each country, we can see that the U.S. stands on top with 0.218 medals, compared to 0.183 and 0.163 medals from Great Britain and China respectively. While this differential isn't absurd, this apparent performance difference would factor in for the USA medal dominance.

Swimming (note this doesn't include marathon swimming). 

| Country | Athletes | Medals | Golds | Medals per Athlete | Golds per Athlete | Golds per Medal |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| USA <img src='https://ssl.gstatic.com/onebox/media/sports/logos/wj9uZvn_vZrelLFGH8fnPA_48x48.png' width='25px' style='margin-top:0px;'/> | 45 | 33 | 16 | 0.750 | 0.364 | 0.485 |
| AUS <img src='https://ssl.gstatic.com/onebox/media/sports/logos/jSgw5z0EPOLzdUi-Aomq7Q_48x48.png' width='25px' style='margin-top:0px;'/> | 37 | 10 | 3  | 0.270 | 0.081 | 0.300 |
| HUN <img src='https://ssl.gstatic.com/onebox/media/sports/logos/YEm-U_1zHCmIknmK5sNcIg_48x48.png' width='25px' style='margin-top:0px;'/> | 35 | 7  | 3  | 0.200 | 0.086 | 0.429 |

Of course when we consider USA Swimming, one might think that these numbers are unfairly slanted due to superstar performances from swimmers like Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky. But if we remove Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky with their 6 total individual medals, the U.S. still stands on top with 0.628 medals per athlete (double either Australia's or Hungary's performance) and 0.256 golds per athlete (triple either Australia's or Hungary's performance).
