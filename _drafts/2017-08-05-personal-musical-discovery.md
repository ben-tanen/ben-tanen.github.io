landing-description: discovering new music with real people, not a computer
---

The original purpose of [Musical Shots](http://musicalshots.tumblr.com/) was to help me discover new music through suggestions from followers. It hasnâ€™t worked as well as I initially planned, but I have found some great suggestions from real people. This idea of music discovery through actual people is refreshing. Tools like Pandora and Last.fm are great, but they lack the human perspective. So, with dozens of computer-driven music discovery sites, why is there no person-based site?

From this question spawned a concept for a person-driven, suggestion based music discovery site.
