landing-description: a scrollytelling project I made to explain Huffman Coding
---

After months of reading and being impressed by the [very](https://pudding.cool/2017/04/beer/){:target="_blank"} [cool](https://pudding.cool/2017/01/making-it-big/){:target="_blank"} [visual](https://pudding.cool/2017/02/vocabulary/){:target="_blank"} [essays](https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/){:target="_blank"} put out by [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/){:target="_blank"}, I decided I would take a crack at a project using what they call "scrollytelling." For my final final project of my undergraduate career, I constructed a visual walk-through to explain and compare [traditional Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding){:target="_blank"} to [adaptive Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Huffman_coding){:target="_blank"}.

If you're interested in learning about Adaptive Huffman Coding, you can find the project [here](http://ben-tanen.github.io/AdaptiveHuffmanCoding/){:target="_blank"}. If you're interested in the code, that can be found [here](https://github.com/ben-tanen/AdaptiveHuffmanCoding){:target="_blank"}. If you're interested in trying out your own scrollytelling project, I would definitely suggest checking out The Pudding's work as well as [this tutorial](https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-implement-scrollytelling/){:target="_blank"} they put together - it was a huge help for me.
