Through some killer [freeform radio hook ups](http://www.wmfo.org/), I was very fortunately connected with the publicity manager for the always fantastic St. Paul and the Broken Bones. Through this connection, I was able to score [an interview with Jesse Phillip](https://www.wmfo.org/?p=3043), the bassist of the band and the lead Broken Bone, as well as a photo pass to their most recent show at the Royale in Boston. They are currently on tour promoting their newest EP *Sea of Noise*, which is [quite the album](http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/491941924/first-listen-st-paul-the-broken-bones-sea-of-noise). If you haven't heard of them before or you haven't heard their latest album, I've put together a little playlist of my personal favorites so feel free to take a listen. My top three have got to be "Is It Me" from *Sea of Noise*, "Call Me" from their first album *Half the City*, and their cover of Sam Cooke's incredible "A Change Is Gonna Come" at SXSW.

Since I was lucky enough to get a photo pass to their show, I thought I'd also share some of personal favorite photos. I'd like to draw your attention to the fantastic dramatics of Paul Janeway and away from the sub-par photography. Enjoy!
