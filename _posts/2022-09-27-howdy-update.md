Hi! Hello! Howdy! It has been a minute since I've written a new post for this site (approx. 881,280 minutes to be more percise). The radio silence has largely been due to a number of life changes that have left me working on personal side projects quite a bit less and thus posting here less. I do have a number of "irons in the fire" as they say, but since who knows when they'll be ready to go, I figured I would just share a mass update on all that has been going on in the last 18 months or so.

### Work + Project Updates

- Iâ€™ve had the amazing opportunity to work on some projects with [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/), including stories on [discrimination in the mortgage industry](https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/08/25/the-secret-bias-hidden-in-mortgage-approval-algorithms), [anti-competitive practices from Amazon](https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products), and the unfair system of how donated organs are allocated throughout the country [link to come].
    - One of the very cool things about working with The Markup, beyond the fact that their work is hugely important by their readers, is that their work just makes a ton of waves in important spots. See these examples of references to some of the work I was able to help out on: [Congress RE: Amazon](https://twitter.com/themarkup/status/1501628432538640384), [Dept. of Justice RE: mortgage redlining](https://twitter.com/MalenaCarollo/status/1451664618808651787), [Last Week Tonight RE: Amazon, Google, and other tech monopolies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXf04bhcjbg)
- Iâ€™ve also been posting periodically over on Observable (as I [previously mentioned]({% post_url 2021-01-13-observable-news %})). It has been a great place to play around with stuff and experiment on things in a lower polish environment. Here are some of the things I worked on:
    - [My tutorial on using `d3-force`](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/a-tutorial-to-using-d3-force-from-someone-who-just-learned-ho) got some traction, which was cool!
    - [I recreated some of my own work related to visualizing musical genres in a 2D map](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/visualizing-musical-genres-using-every-noise-at-once) (and [set up some code to scrape the ever-changing genre landscape](https://github.com/ben-tanen/spotify-genre-map))
    - Back when Wordle was all the rage, I put together this [Wordle Results Tracker](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/wordle-results-tracker) to play around with the data (plus I wrote [some code for scraping Wordle results from Twitter](https://github.com/ben-tanen/wordle))
    - [I made a map analyzing the relationship between partisanship and MLB fandoms](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/partisanship-and-the-mlb?collection=@ben-tanen/recreations), as a sequel to [this older project](http://ben-tanen.com/projects/2017/10/07/partisanship-in-football.html)
    - I also recreated a bunch of work from other folks, which really helped me work on my own skills! Some examples â‡’ [from Lazaro Gamio at NYT](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/how-500-000-coronavirus-deaths-added-up), [from Will Chase at Axios](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/how-senate-control-could-flip-with-1-resignation-retiremen), [from The Washington Post](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/the-inescapable-overlap-of-pandemic-and-politics), [from Danielle Alberti at Axios](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/the-relentless-2020-news-cycle-in-one-chart), [from The Marshall Project](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/1-in-5-prisoners-in-the-u-s-has-had-covid-19)
- While working on some of the above projects, inspired by some data viz/coding Twitch streamers, I dabbled in [recording my project work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_Nc8Igf1UOTZOkksRAxhzPf5uz3QmMKV). Please be gentle if you choose to watch ðŸ™ƒ
- As part of my day-job, Iâ€™ve had the chance to more thoroughly enjoy all the amazing stuff getting published across the web so I wanted to better document some of the amazing stuff that inspires me - maybe itâ€™ll inspire you too! Check it out over on [Notion](https://btnotion.notion.site/ccb6582646834f6ea4194817c2470ab4?v=3d266c5c791744abb47d19d446eb1ad7).
- Speaking of Notion, once [Heroku decided to get rid of their free tier](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter), I decided to migrate some of the content from my website over to Notion as well - feel free to check it out on [my public BT Notion](https://btnotion.notion.site/Welcome-to-BT-Notion-23406746c8f64abaa8108e4bc75bf51f).

### Other Personal Updates

- I got a new job at Spotify in May 2021! Iâ€™m a data scientist and data visualization specialist who focuses on helping understand and visualize trends in music and talk (podcast, radio) content on Spotify.
- I got engaged in May 2022! My fiancÃ©e and I (and Penny) are all very excited!

{% include section-break.html %}

And that's about it! As I mentioned, I am working on other stuff, but I'm unsure when exactly they'll be out and/or shared here, so until then, feel free to check for other updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ben_tanen/) and [Notion](https://btnotion.notion.site/Welcome-to-BT-Notion-23406746c8f64abaa8108e4bc75bf51f). Peace out for now!
