As [previously mentioned]({% post_url 2023-12-01-wrapped-sound-town %}), I was very fortunate to pitch and implement an original story called "Sound Town" that was added into thw 2023 Spotify Wrapped personalized user data experience. While I was most excited about the Sound Town (then known as "Musical Hometown") idea, I pitched a handful of other ideas that didn't quite make the cut for one reason or another. But even though they didn't make it into the experience, I still wanted to memorialize some of the interesting ideas, just in case someone else wanted to take them and run with it. So, I present a handful of ideas that didn't quite make the cut for 2023 Wrapped.
