Do you ever need or want a simple Internet tool and it seems like it would be easier code it than find it? That is exactly what happened when I needed a beeping censor for [my radio show](http://wmfo.org). Sometimes bands like to swear and I needed a button / website to defend the honor of the FCC. Thus, I made this really [stupid site](http://ben-tanen.github.io/CensorMachine/). But hey, now I have it.
