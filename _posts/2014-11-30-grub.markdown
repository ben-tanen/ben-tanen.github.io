GitHub is built on the fantastically useful Git. Many people may prefer to use the desktop / online UI (GitHub desktop app or through GitHub directly). However, most people - myself included - prefer to use Git directly from the command-line. So what if there was an equivalent alternative for other "Hub" sites like GrubHub? The answer to that question is the (thus far imaginary idea) Grub, the command-line tool for GrubHub.

Basically, using similar syntax to Git, users can search and order food from local restaurants using the command line. Examples include:
{% highlight c++ %} 
// search database for food type or restaurant
grub search "burrito"
grub search "Bob's Burgers"

// add chicken burrito with cheese & sour cream
grub add order burrito-chicken -w {cheese, sour cream} 

// add burger without pickles
grub add order burger -wo pickles

// go to checkout and add payment information 
grub checkout

// place order
grub pull order
{% endhighlight %}

Obviously this idea is a little on the ridiculous side, but who says ridiculous ideas can't be awesome? Hey, if [gti init](http://r-wos.org/hacks/gti) can be a thing, why can't Grub? Check back for any future developments into the command-line food delivery service of the future.
