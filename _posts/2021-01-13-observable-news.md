After many months of being intrigued yet afraid of Observable, I have finally decided to dive in and check it out. For those unaware, Observable is a fantastic resource/community for anyone wanting to experiment and build things on the internet, especially for visualization and creative coding. An improvement upon Mike Bostock's [bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/), Bostock and company created a wonderful and easy way to build via interactive web-enabled notebooks, which allows for quick building and easy collaboration. If you do any data visualization in D3 or generative art in p5, I would highly recommend checking it out.

In the last few days, I've been using it a place to work on my D3 chops, most notably by recreating some of my favorite visualizations from around the web (and [one of my own](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/visualizing-musical-genres-using-every-noise-at-once)). I also finally decided to try playing around with `d3-force` and ended up putting together a little tutorial (see below or [here](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/a-tutorial-to-using-d3-force-from-someone-who-just-learned-ho)).

In the weeks and months to come, I'll keep playing around and things will pop up on my page over time. I hope to see you over there on Observable!
