Hello! It seems like I'm getting into a routine of posting an annual message about what I have (or haven't) been working on in the last year. Well, here we are again!

Since changing jobs back in 2021 and starting up [freelance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/21/liver-transplants-acuity-circle-policy/) [with](https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products) [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/08/25/the-secret-bias-hidden-in-mortgage-approval-algorithms), I've found myself with less time for side projects. This, however, hasn't stopped me from coming up with a plethora of ideas for projects that sit in notebooks and Notion pages and to-do lists. I do find some time here or there where I'll start something, write code or analyze data for a few hours, and then lose steam because the project was bigger than expected, outcomes weren't as interesting as expected, or just, ya know, life.

I actually asked the team over at [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) about this a few years ago, which prompted them to write [this post](https://pudding.cool/process/pivot-continue-down/), which I think does a great job to outline an aspirational approach to answer the question of when to continue, pivot, or put down on a project. I found myself doing a lot of putting down for the sake of time availability, but today I'm hoping to embrace the continue and pivot parts a bit more!

I was starting projects and then stopping because I struggled to materialize my work into a more polished story that felt warranted of <span id="footnote-1" class="footnote">*a whole new page* on my website</span>. But sometimes the real treasures are the real friends we made (read as, code / data analysis I wrote) along the way. So, in the spirit of lowering the bar, I'm going to start putting some smaller and/or partial projects over on Notion and I'll periodically share a combined update with them here.

<script>
new jBox('Tooltip', {
  attach: '#footnote-1',
  content: "I am clearly overthinking and overestimating the 'quality' associated with this blog that no one reads..."
});
</script>

So, to kick it off, here's a collection of smaller projects that I have been working on in the last few years that felt like they needed wrapping up:

1. Inspired by my fiancÃ©e's "California" playlist, I used Spotify's API to see how often artists are making songs about each U.S. state. TL;DR: New York takes the top spot! => check it out on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/btnotion/What-are-the-most-sung-about-states-c5a4d86090e140c191922f3cf5251da1?pvs=4) or [Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/e291342a195d36c9).
2.  Inspired by [this tweet from John Dickerson](https://twitter.com/jdickerson/status/1382872170943156227), I decided to explore how often "split ticket senators" (e.g., Republican senators elected in years where their state voted for a Democrat for president) appear in recent history. More to explore here, but unsurprisingly, we're at an all-time low in recent years! => check it out on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/btnotion/Where-did-all-the-split-ticket-senators-go-bde24fd68ac345c6b25769df36bfad7c?pvs=4).
3. Since I've used Letterboxd for close to 5 years now, I've been curious to know who my "secret favorite" filmmakers are, or the filmmakers for whom I've watched a surprisingly large share of their overall work. That led me down a rabbit hole of scraping lots of film meta data from Letterboxd and ultimately introduced me to the work of John Morris, Joonas Suotamo, and Mel Blanc => check it out on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/btnotion/Who-are-my-top-Letterboxd-filmmakers-427c79a7b7364e76a203fbf175a8afa5?pvs=4)
4. For many years now, I've been very interested in the prevalence of good quality captions on YouTube. In an effort to find out how often popular videos have auto- vs. human-generated captions, I wrote a whole bunch of code to scrape this informaiton from YouTube. After generating a bunch of data, I ultimately put the project on hold, but you can check out my thoughts on the project on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/btnotion/Why-are-good-captions-so-rare-on-YouTube-2d963ebc08d04c1faf123468135bf6ab?pvs=4)
5. I wrote [a mildly successful tutorial](https://observablehq.com/@ben-tanen/a-tutorial-to-using-d3-force-from-someone-who-just-learned-ho) on using `d3-force` for graph simulations, which led me to work on a bunch of small experiments with custom forces. You can check them out on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/2a329eb1c6d1971f).
6. A came across a TikTok a few years ago that highlighted how Clinton, G.W. Bush, Trump, and Biden were also born within a few years of each other, which was quite surprising to me. I decided to explore the presidential timeline a bit, which you can check out on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/btnotion/When-were-all-the-presidents-alive-d82209890fe94b9b975aba3c3b0267b5?pvs=4)
7. I really, really liked [Harry Steven's Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@harrystevens/directly-labelling-lines) outlining his approach for intelligently labeling lines in a plot, so for my own educational purposes, I decided to recreate it in my own tutorial. Feel free to check it out on [Observable](https://www.notion.so/btnotion/How-to-Directly-Labeling-Lines-be78dfb984fd4c1e8a3bdff3ff9fac34?pvs=4)

That's all for now - see y'all again in a year (or hopefully sooner)!
