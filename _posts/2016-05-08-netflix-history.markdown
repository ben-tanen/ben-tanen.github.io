TV is pretty incredible, and I'll admit I might binge-watch from time to time. In fact, I've been binge-watching since before it was cool - I watched all of The Office on Netflix back in 2009 when there were only 4 season available. So I decided to see what this history of binge-watching looked like.

Getting the information was pretty simple. I just had to scrape the data via Netflix's own viewing history page, clean it a bit, and then pipe it into MATLAB.

I find it interesting that there are huge spikes during my winter breaks but dips during my summer breaks. Maybe I was playing outside... One thing is for sure, I definitely watch a lot of TV.

**Note**: This is only the TV I've watched via Netflix and doesn't include when I've watched shows offline (like Community, Billions, etc).
