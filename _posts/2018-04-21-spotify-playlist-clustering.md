[In ..., Spotify started rolling out their Daily Mix feature, which would provide users with a handful of smaller playlists of different types / genres. Depending on your musical taste, you might get a playlist of hip-hop, one of acoustic rock, and one of indie-pop. Given Spotify's mass amount of audio analystics and listening data, this sort of musical playlist creation seems pretty easy. I was curious if I could accomplish something similar using my own methods. ]
