In the pursuit of [visualizing font design trends]({% post_url 2019-04-03-most-font %}), I did a lot of playing around in Processing. Here is a collection of some random animations/sketches I made while working on the project.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/img/posts/processing-ex-sort1.gif" alt="Sorting animation made in Processing" %}

<div class="columns two">
    <div class="column">
        {% include figure.html autolink="yes" src="/assets/img/posts/processing-ex-flower.gif" alt="An animated random flower made in Processing" %}
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        {% include figure.html autolink="yes" src="/assets/img/posts/processing-ex-letter-grid.gif" alt="A cycle of random fonts per letter made in Processing" %}
    </div>
</div>

{% include figure.html src="/assets/img/posts/processing-ex-sort2.gif" alt="Another sorting animation made in Processing" %}
