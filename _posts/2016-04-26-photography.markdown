Before I became all lame, I use to be fairly into photography. I was never superb myself but I loved to experiment with things. I adored light painting and spent hours trying to make cool patterns with some fancy glow sticks.

I haven't been able to take many photos recently but I felt like sharing some of my personal favorites from the past few years. I hope to maybe add some more as time goes on.

<style>
    .photo_container {
    }

    .photo_container img {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 5px 5px 0 0;
    }

    .sub_photo_container {
        width: 49%;
        display: inline-block;
        vertical-align: top;
    }

</style>

<div class='photo_container'>
