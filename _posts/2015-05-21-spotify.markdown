For years, I was a huge iTunes user. It was the best music player available but it certainly did have its issues. When Spotify started to gain traction, I was wary of switching to the service for a few reasons. How could I accumulate a library of music if I didn't actually own the music? Or what if I'm not connected to the internet? But as my roommate continued to rave about Spotify, I decided I had to jump in and just try it out (of course using one of their many trial / offer periods).

And you know what? I love Spotify. Every concern I had was quickly answered because they have thought of everything. Want to have music while you're out of cell range? No worries, you can download playlists straight to your phone or computer. Want to listen to a brand-new remix that isn't on Spotify? Loading and listening to local / custom files is easy. And that is just the simple stuff. If you know anyone who uses Spotify, I'm sure you've heard a similar raving review. But if you're still not convinced, here is why I think you should at least consider trying Spotify Premium (as I said they have lots of trial offers):

- **Instant Access to Millions of Songs**: Of course you've heard that Spotify has lots of songs available, which isn't necessarily jaw-dropping. But when you compare it to Spotify's competitors, 30-million songs is a hell of a lot for $10 / month (or $5 / month if you're a student). For $10 on iTunes, you get 7 - 10 songs a month. But maybe you're considering about getting more than 10 songs a month in a less, perhaps, legal way. That might work until you get a cease and desist e-mail for a lot more than $10. So at the end of the day, 30-million songs for $10 / month is a might fine deal.

- **Crazy Good Cross-Syncing**: Apple seems very proud of their cross-syncing platform iCloud and to be honest, it is pretty good. But iCloud doesn't even compare to Spotify's syncing across their different platforms. If you're listening to a song on your computer and you add it to your library, it shows up on your phone that instant. And you can literally swap over to your phone that instant, picking up that song exactly where you left it off. In fact you can do this across the desktop, browser, and phone apps without even missing a beat. As far as I know, iCloud or any other competitor can't even come close to that.

- **Spotify Mobile is Amazing**: In my opinion, the crown jewel of Spotify has to be their mobile app. If you're a premium user, you get the same unlimited music access on your phone that you would in the desktop app. That means you get the ability search through Spotify's whole catalog, browse artist updates, and sample and queue up songs (a lot of which is still not doable on the iTunes equivalent app). In order to all this, Spotify didn't waste any space as they crammed all the functionality into a cohesive, absolutely gorgeous mobile app. You're really not using Spotify until you're using the mobile version.
